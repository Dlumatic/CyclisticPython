# CyclisticPython

Notebook and Dataset derived from Kaggle.

This  Capstone project is part of the Google Data Analytics Certification offered through Coursera.  Upon completion of the project,  the certifcate is granted to the recipient who finished the course.  

The project consist of an exploratory analysis of the fictional bike company Cyclistic.  It is a bike sharing company located in the metropolitan area of Chicago.   In this analysis,  we are cleaning and analyzing the data of bike users.  Trends are uncovered from the data, and from that strategic business insights and strategies can be derived to improve business operations and profit.  The project provides details for shareholders to make informed decisions.

Business Task

Analyze the company's historical bike data in order to identify trends between annual and casual riders that bring specific insights.

Ask

Three questions will guide the future marketing program: 
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

ACT


Doubling down on casual riders on the weekend would create a great source of continued revenue. Increasing marketing campaigns and incentives to get more people to ride on weeekends would be a viable move for attracting more riders.

Scaling more riders in with multiple ridership packages can be an attractive model. A second order effect of converting them to members would be a good pivot (incentivized cheaper rates for members).

A gamification system of giving riders perks based on rider usage could be a new alluring model. Rewards such as free miles can be an attractive perk. Members can also spare or give miles to other family members or friends to use.

Data Visualizations are included in this ReadMe incase they don't load properly within the Python notebook.
